Setup


Tests that need to be written

contraction_utils.cpp
	243
		in method ContractionData::ContractGrid
		if the contraction didn't end up with 1 tensor, fail and print tensor
		Testing
			Handled by SimpleInitializeData??
	376
		in method index_name(vector1, vector2)
		'Failed to construct tensor name'
		print vectors
		Testing
			Handled by IndexNamingFailures test
	387
		in method index_name(vector, tensors)
		'Failed to construct tensor name'
		print vector and tensors
		Testing
			Handled by IndexNamingFailures test
	497
		in external method ContractGrid
		'Amplitude return vectors must be non-null'
		just print message
		Testing
			Is not tested?
	498
		in external method ContractGrid
		checks IsOrderingValid()
		Testing
			Is not tested??

read_circuit.cpp
	234, 252, 295
		in order_func, a helper function for grid_of_tensors 3d_to_2d
		occurs when  there is a pair not found
		snprintf(error)
		There are no tests for order_func!!
	321
		in circuit_data_to_grid_of_tensors()
		checks that num_qubits == I * J
		Not tested??
	326
		in circuit_data_to_grid_of_tensors()
		checks length of initial_conf
		Not tested
	328
		in circuit_data_to_grid_of_tensors()
		checks length of final_conf
		Not tested
	638
		in read_wave_function_evolution()
		checks that file can be read 
		Not tested
	651
		in read_wave_function_evolution()
		Checks that I matches the number of num_qubits
		Not tested
